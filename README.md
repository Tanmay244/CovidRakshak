All the necessary modules and the dependencies can be downloaded using ```pip installer``` using the ```requirements.txt``` file
Best suited to run the program on IDLE and Python 3.7 on a Windows system.

## How to use it?
1. Download the zip file of the project,
2. Extract the files into the same folder,
3. Run the ```GUI-RUN THIS.py``` file, and
4. The user-friendly menu window will pop up, use it to navigate through various modules.

**This is how the menu page looks like, you can click the buttons for respective modules to work**

## Demonstration of each module

### Adding COVID Patients into the database
Click the video below to see how to add a COVID patient into the database. The status can be set as *positive* or *at risk*.

### Deleting a COVID patient record from the database
Click the video below to see how to delete a record of a COVID patient. If the person recovers, we can then remove that person's record from the database.

### Detecting Whether the person is wearing mask or not 
Click the video below to see the demonstration of how the module classifies a person *with mask* or *without mask*. Can be implemented in places where
we can automate surveillance of Face mask wearers.

### Face Recognition of COVID patients roaming out
Click the video below to see how the module recognizes faces, and marks them with names and their status *Positive or At risk*. Can be implemented for
automating the surveillance of those patients who are roaming in public areas and can have higher chances of spreding the disease. Also, maintains a database of the
ID, Person's name, Date and Time when the person was last spotted.

**You can even detect more than 1 patient in one frame, example below!**

![Detects 2 faces at once](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60519359/89704534-1761b580-d972-11ea-9520-aa42091c4c3c.jpeg)


### Social Distance detection through CCTV camera Live Feed
Click the video below to see how the module tracks people and marks them with red/green boxes to keep a track of the amount of social distance violations.
Can be implemented for automating the surveillance rather than using actual police force. Also shows the necessary statistics.
